# Reduction Operations

```python
import torch

class ReductionKernel:
    """
    Various reduction operations (sum, mean, max, min)
    """
    def __init__(self):
        pass

    def sum_reduce(self, x, dim=None):
        return torch.sum(x, dim=dim)

    def mean_reduce(self, x, dim=None):
        return torch.mean(x, dim=dim)

    def max_reduce(self, x, dim=None):

```
